    Welcome to the **Water Potability Prediction Tool**! 🌊
    This tool can help you determine whether the water is potable or not based on various parameters.

    **Features:**
    * Enter key parameters related to water quality
    * Get a prediction on whether the water is potable or not
    * View the percentage of purity for better understanding

    🌟 Give it a try and see the result! 🌟
